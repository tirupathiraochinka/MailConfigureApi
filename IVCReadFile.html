Can you send the lawyers a photo of the Medical Device ID Card, or, can you send photos of even one page of your Medical Records that shows the manufacturer and model of your IVC device? If you do not have an ID Card or your Medical Records, it would be best if you call your doctor now for your information. Please understand, this legal action is NOT against your doctor or hospital, it is against the manufacturers of these defective medical devices.</td>
